## Welcome to my projects highlight.

Here I show some highlights of results I have gotten through my career.  

# Undergraduate Thesis

My undergraduate thesis was on extending multi resolution schemes to ellipsoids, or in other words, apply subdivision schemes to curves on the surfaces of ellipsoids (this was not published but I am currently trying to fix that :)).

## Personal

These are old projects I did outside of a school setting out of personal interest:

### Voxel Tracing

Implemented a voxel tracer and applied it to the sponza scene:

### Real time voxelizer

Implemented GPU voxelization of arbitrary geometry in real time. The technique is based on using the 2D rasterizer to generate the voxels, then storing the result in either a sparse voxel oct tree or an 3D image storage buffer.

### Voxel Terrain Generator

We have all done this project based on perlin noise at one point, here's mine:

## Undergrad

Here are some of my undergraduate projects that I did as part of courses:


### Cloth Simulation and Jiggly Cube

Procedural animations made for the computer animation course. Both simulations are based on spring mass systems. The wind in the drap scene was generated through 2D perlin noise that pplied a force tangential to the current normal of each vertex.

### Boids

Bird-oid objects. A swarm simulation project done as part of an emergent computing course:

### Haptic deformation

Haptic rubber like object defformation. Done as part os a special topics course on computer haptics. The project displays a possible technique inspired on spring mass models to allow users to interact with deformable objects that felt somewhat like rubber.

(I have no video, as we never thought of recording it and I don;t have neither the source code nor a Novint Falcon to run it anymore).

### Cornell Box and Orrery

Introduction to computer graphics. The cornell box was my first raytraced project, the orrery is a non scientific model of our solar system, including all the satelites of every planet and day/night rendering for the earth.
