## Welcome to my projects highlight.

Here I show some highlights of results I have gotten through my career.  

## Undergrad

Here are some of my undergraduate projects that I did as part of courses:


## Cloth Simulation and Jiggly Cube

Procedural animations made for the computer animation course. Both simulations are based on spring mass systems:

## Haptic deformation

Haptic rubber like object defformation. DOne as part os a special topics course on computer haptics. The project displays a possible technique inspired on spring mass models to allow users to interact with deformable objects that felt somewhat like rubber.

(I have no video, as we never thought of recording it and I don;t have neither the source code nor a Novint Falcon to run it anymore).

## Cornell Box and Orrery

Introduction to computer graphics. The cornell box was my first raytraced project, the orrery is a non scientific model of our solar system, including all the satelites of every planet and day/night rendering for the earth.
